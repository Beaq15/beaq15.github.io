## General information

Ice Land is a single player video game where the main character is Elsa, the ice princess who has to fight monsters in order to escape through an igloo. 

The main menu contains two buttons which can be selected using the right or left arrows: play or quit, and then pressed using the enter key.

In the map screen the player can only walk on the snowy path where chests containing power-ups can be found and she is taken to the battle screen when an enemy is encountered.

During the battle, the player can use items and power-ups found throughout the map: Life Regen, Attack Boost, Defense Boost and Bomb. All monsters need to be defeated before escaping.

The game from game.cpp loads all my screens. The starting game state is the MainMenu and when the play button is pressed, it updates and draws the MapScreen. If the player’s position is the same as an enemy’s, the BattleScreen is loaded and if the battle ends, it then goes back to the MapScreen.

## Controls

-WASD - move the player around

-ENTER - skip a text box and attack
