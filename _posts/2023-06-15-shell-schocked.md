description: 3D team game in Unreal Engine 5 as first year students

## 🎓 Development Notes
Shell Shocked was developed as an 8-week group project during my first year at university with a team of 14 people. This project provided hands-on experience with Unreal Engine 5, team collaboration in a large group setting, shader research, gameplay programming, and the full development pipeline from concept to polished product. Working within time constraints and coordinating with a multi-disciplinary team taught valuable lessons about project management and feature prioritization.

## 🎮 Project Overview
Shell Shocked is a chaotic 2v2 couch co-op game where players control mechanized hermit crabs competing to push a mine into the opposing team's goal. The game combines fast-paced action with strategic gameplay as players stun opponents, shoot shells, and knock the ball around the arena to score points.

**Tech Stack:** Unreal Engine 5, C++, Blueprints

**Team Size:** 14 people (8-week project)

### Key Features:

- 2v2 local multiplayer gameplay
- Physics-based ball mechanics with shooting and stunning
- Dynamic camera effects (slow motion, freeze frames)
- Haptic feedback integration for controller immersion
- Custom water shader research (UE5 water plugin)

## 💫 My contributions

### Water Shader Research
My primary technical contribution involved researching and experimenting with water shaders using the Unreal Engine 5 water plugin. I explored various shader techniques and configurations to create realistic water visuals for the underwater arena setting.

While I gained valuable insights through this experimentation and developed a working prototype, various project constraints—including performance considerations on target hardware and time limitations—prevented us from implementing the custom water shader in the final game. However, the research process provided deep understanding of UE5's material system and shader development workflow.

### 🔧 Technical Implementation
## Gameplay Features - Camera Effects
I implemented dynamic camera effects to enhance the game's impact during key moments:

- Slow Motion System - Triggered during goal scoring moments to emphasize successful plays and create dramatic highlight moments
- Freeze Frames - Applied at endgame to punctuate the match conclusion and give players a moment to process the outcome

These systems add visual polish and improve game feel by making important events more memorable.

### Haptic Feedback Integration
Implemented haptic feedback for various player actions to increase immersion and provide tactile response:

- Stun Feedback - Controller vibration when players get stunned by opponents
- Shell Pickup - Haptic response when collecting or shooting shells
- Impact Events - Feedback for ball collisions and player interactions

This sensory feedback layer helps players understand game state without relying solely on visual cues.

### Bug Fixing & Polish
I dedicated significant development time to bug fixing and quality assurance to ensure Shell Shocked was as polished and presentable as possible for the final showcase. This involved playtesting, identifying edge cases, and coordinating with team members to resolve issues across different systems.

## 📸 Additional Information
**Project Duration:** 8 weeks

**Team Composition:** 14 members (programmers, artists, designers)

**My Role:** Gameplay Programmer - Water shader R&D, camera effects, haptic feedback, QA
