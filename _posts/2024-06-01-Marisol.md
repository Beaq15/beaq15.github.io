description: 3D team game developed in UE5 as second year students  
---

## 🎓 Development Notes
Marisol was developed as an 8-week student project by a team of 23 second-year students from Breda University of Applied Sciences. This project provided experience working in a large interdisciplinary team, coordinating with artists and designers, and implementing core gameplay systems in Unreal Engine 5. My role focused on the 3C's (Character, Camera, Controls) strike team, where I refined player experience through camera systems, combat mechanics, and player feedback systems.

## 🎮 Project Overview
Dive into the world of Marisol and retrieve the magical crystal to save the local people. During your adventure, enemies will try to hold you back, and there will be puzzles that require solving.

**Tech Stack:** Unreal Engine 5, Blueprints, C++

**Team Size:** 23 students (8-week project)

### Key Features:

- Dynamic camera system with smooth transitions
- Combat mechanics with shield defense system
- Player respawn with fade transitions
- Dialogue system with custom font integration
- Third-person action-adventure gameplay

## 💫 My Contributions
### Camera System
As part of the 3C's strike team, I worked on refining the camera to make it feel natural and responsive for the player. The system includes several sophisticated features:

### Key Implementations:

- Smooth transitions between over-the-shoulder and distant camera views
- Anti-clipping system preventing camera collision with walls and objects
- Trigger-based camera focus system that temporarily locks onto specific objects
- Dynamic player slowdown and restricted camera control during focus events
- Pitch limitation preventing excessive upward/downward camera tilt
- Adaptive camera arm length that extends when looking up and shortens when looking down

These features work together to create a cinematic feel while maintaining player control and preventing disorienting camera behavior.

## 🔧 Gameplay Systems
### Shield Mechanics
I implemented the main character's shield defense system, which serves as a core combat mechanic. The shield can be activated by pressing a button and provides the following functionality:

- Blocks incoming damage from enemies
- Restricts player movement while active, creating tactical decision-making
- Protects against projectile attacks

Additionally, I integrated the ground ripple projectile attack to properly deal damage to the player, completing the enemy-player interaction loop.

### Respawn System
I created a player respawn system that handles death and revival gracefully:
System Flow:

1. Upon death, player teleports to the starting location after a 2-second delay
2. Health is reset to maximum and the health widget updates accordingly
3. Screen fades to black for smooth visual transition
4. Movement and camera controls are restricted during the respawn process to prevent disorienting player input

This ensures players can quickly return to gameplay without jarring transitions or confusing states.

### Dialogue System
For the dialogue system, I created a data table containing all necessary dialogue text. A significant challenge arose when implementing the custom font provided by our artists—punctuation marks weren't rendering properly. I collaborated closely with the art team to find a solution that allowed us to use the custom font while maintaining proper text display.

#### Technical Implementation:

- Data table-driven dialogue content management
- Dynamic image switching for character portraits and name displays based on talk index
- Custom font integration with punctuation rendering fixes
- Attempted implementation of synchronized NPC talk animations (ongoing challenge)

## 🐛 Quality Assurance
### Bug Fixing & Map Testing
To ensure the best possible player experience, I dedicated significant time to:

- Testing and fixing gameplay bugs
- Thoroughly checking the entire map for collision issues
- Identifying and fixing areas where players could fall through geometry
- Resolving locations where players could get stuck
- Playtesting to catch edge cases and unusual interactions

This QA work was essential for delivering a polished final product and ensuring players could complete the game without technical frustrations.
