## 💫 My contribution

### ⚪ Camera
As part of the 3C’s strike team, I worked on refining the camera to make it feel natural and responsive for the player. I implemented smooth transitions between an over-the-shoulder view and a distant view, while ensuring the camera would not clip through walls or other objects in the scene. Additionally, I added a trigger system that briefly locks the camera onto a specific object, slowing the player and preventing manual camera control during the focus. To improve usability, I limited the camera pitch so it cannot tilt too far up or down, and I adjusted the camera arm length dynamically—extending when looking up and shortening when looking down.

### ⚪ Shield

I also worked on the main character's shield implementation. It can be set active by pressing a button, makes you unable to move while active and protects you from taking damage. I also made the ground ripple projectile deal damage to the player since that wasn't already implemented.

### ⚪ Respawn system

Once the player dies, it teleports to the player start location after a delay of 2 seconds. I manually set the current health back to max health and also update the health widget. So that the change doesn't feel too sudden, I made the screen fade out to black. After it dies, the player has its movement and camera restricted until it teleports.

### ⚪ Dialogue system

For the dialogue system I first created a data table where I added all the necessary text for the dialogue. However, when I added the font given by one of the artists, the punctuation marks couldn't be seen properly so we worked together in finding a solution for it because we really didn't want to use the default font. 

Based on each talk index, I set the correct images for the speech and name.
I also worked on making the talk animation of the NPC only run when the correct line of dialogue is on screen, but couldn't manage to.

### ⚪ Bug fixing

To ensure the best possible experience, I dedicated time to testing and fixing bugs in the game, as well as thoroughly checking the map for areas where the player could fall through or get stuck.
